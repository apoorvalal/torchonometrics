    "# The Red Bus / Blue Bus Paradox and Fixing it with Matrix-Completion (Mixed) Logit\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates the famous Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA)\n",
    "problem in standard multinomial logit models and shows how low-rank logit avoids it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup:\n",
    "- 3 initial products: Car, Train, Red Bus\n",
    "- Each product is quite distinct with baseline market shares\n",
    "- We then add Blue Bus (very similar to Red Bus)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected behavior:\n",
    "- Blue Bus should primarily cannibalize Red Bus (they're substitutes)\n",
    "- Car and Train shares should remain relatively stable\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard MNL problem (IIA):\n",
    "- Adds Blue Bus → all products lose market share proportionally \n",
    "- This is unrealistic: why would Car and Train lose share equally to Red Bus?\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-rank logit solution:\n",
    "- Captures heterogeneous preferences (bus-lovers, train-lovers, car-lovers)\n",
    "- Blue Bus cannibalizes Red Bus primarily, as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives - Nested Logit, Multinomial Probit with full covariance:\n",
    "- Nested Logit requires pre-defined nests (e.g., grouping buses) and has a fugly likelihood\n",
    "- Multinomial Probit with full covariance has no closed-form likelihood and requires bespoke and brittle simulation-based estimation (GHK simulator etc)"
